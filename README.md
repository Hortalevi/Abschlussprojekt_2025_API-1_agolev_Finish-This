Finish This! -- Multiplayer Sentence Ending Game
===============================================

Description:\
"Finish This!" is a web-based multiplayer game where players receive a random sentence starter and must creatively complete it. All sentence endings are then anonymously displayed and voted on using emojis. The player with the most points at the end wins.

Project Structure:

-   **Frontend:** React + TypeScript

-   **Backend:** Node.js (or Java)

-   **Database (optional):** PostgreSQL or in-memory structure for testing

-   **Communication:** WebSocket or REST API simulation

-   **Styling:** CSS (with optional Tailwind or custom styling)

How It Works:

1.  Players enter a nickname and room code to join a game session.

2.  Once everyone has joined, a random sentence starter is shown.

3.  Players write a creative ending to the sentence.

4.  All endings are shown anonymously.

5.  Players vote using emojis.

6.  Points are awarded. The game continues over multiple rounds.

Project Goals:

-   Build a working multiplayer prototype within 12 development days.
